# WMAS-subset
Subsets of the WMAS API specification for specific purposes including ATSC3.0/HbbTV usage. 

More: 
While the Web Media API Snapshot specification is appropriate for web media apps using HTML5/MSE/EME, there are other uses in which a subset of the API 
list can be helpful. One example is for ATSC3.0 Broadcast Apps ("BA's"), which are primariliy a JSON-based messaging app rather than a video player. However, 
such BA's still must draw themselves in the User Agent, still must use fonts and (many) other W3C APIs. This repo initially contains a WMAS subset for ATSC3.0 
and HbbTV (one subset covering both).
